Assignments (as discussed):

  - Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>First Exercise</h1>
    <p id="sum"></p>
    <script>
      function exercise(p1, p2) {
        return p1 + p2;
      }
      document.getElementById("sum").innerHTML = exercise(5, 5);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

  - Write a function that takes one argument, an array of two numbers, and returns the sum of the two elements

  - Write a function that takes an array and returns the last element

  - Write a function that takes two arrays of the same size and
  returns an array that is the element-by-element sum of the two
  arrays. For example, if the two arrays are [7, 1, 5] and [8, 7, 22],
  the resulting array would be [15, 8, 27]

  - Write a function that takes an array and return a new array that
  contains two elements: the smallest and largest values of the array
  sent in as an argument. For example, if the array sent it as input
  is [7, 4, 1, 2, 9, 8], the return array would be [1, 9] because 1
  and 9 are the smallest and largest values in the array.

  - Write a function that takes an Object and returns true if the
  object's "firstname" property is "Samuel", and false otherwise.
