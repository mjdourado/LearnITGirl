Assignments (as discussed):

  - Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum

  - Write a function that takes one argument, an array of two numbers, and returns the sum of the two elements

  - Write a function that takes an array and returns the last element

  - Write a function that takes two arrays of the same size and
  returns an array that is the element-by-element sum of the two
  arrays. For example, if the two arrays are [7, 1, 5] and [8, 7, 22],
  the resulting array would be [15, 8, 27]

  - Write a function that takes an array and return a new array that
  contains two elements: the smallest and largest values of the array
  sent in as an argument. For example, if the array sent it as input
  is [7, 4, 1, 2, 9, 8], the return array would be [1, 9] because 1
  and 9 are the smallest and largest values in the array.

  - Write a function that takes an Object and returns true if the
  object's "firstname" property is "Samuel", and false otherwise.

  - Write a function that adds the positive elements of a given array. For exmaple, if the input array is [7, -5, 2, 15, -6], the function would return 24, because that's 7 + 2 + 15, and ignore the negative numbers

  - Write a function that returns true if any element in an array is
  repeated and false if no elements are repeated. For example, [7, 1,
  2, 5, 7] would return true because 7 is repeated, where as [5, 17,
  21, 14, 2] would return false because no elements are repeated.
